# MLaaS

MLaaS sells the service of providing machine learning algorithms via HTTP. With 
increasing success of our company, the demand for better infrastructure increases 
to serve all incoming web requests successfully. We don't want to allocate too 
many resources as that would be too costly. On the other side, we will lose money, 
if we have not reserved enough resources to serve all incoming requests. Now, 
the question is, when will we hit the limit of our current infrastructure, which we 
estimated to be at 100,000 requests per hour. We would like to know inadvance 
when we have to request additional servers in the cloud to serve all the incoming 
requests successfully without paying for unused ones.
